The very first Queen release. Released in UK (6 July 1973), in US (8 October 1973), in Japan* (March 1974), Australia and New Zealand (1974), Canada, Angola*, Chile, France, Ireland, Mexico, Holland*, Portugal*, South Africa, Venezuela. Only releases in countries indicated by * had picture sleeves. Australia and New Zealand used a special “censored” version of “Son And Daughter” on B side, with the word “shit” edited out.

Did not chart in the UK or US.

In 1975 re-released by Electra in North America (on 15 July 1975) and Australia with different B-side, no picture sleeve. Originally the idea was to use the new specially re-recorded version, now known as “long lost re-take”. However due to some technical problems, the new edit of the original version was used instead. B side featured a unique original version of “God Save The Queen”, which was never released before, since the single was issued several months before “A Night At The Opera”.

The promo CD was released in 1998 in the US to promote the 'Crown Jewels' box set with new remasters of the first 8 Queen studio albums. This release had a unique cover art and featured the standard album version twice - as 1991 remaster and as 1998 remaster.

On 16 April 2011 a special 7" reissue was released in the US by Hollywood Records for Record Store Day.

Both the 2008 CD single and 2011 Record Store Day 7" used the original Portugal/Angola picture sleeve.
