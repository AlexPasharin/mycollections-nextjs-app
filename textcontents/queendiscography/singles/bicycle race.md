Originally released in UK (13 October 1978), US (24 October 1978), Japan (November 1978), Hungary, France, Italy, Australia, Canada, Holland, Spain, Germany, Belgium, New Zealand, Yugoslavia (with album version of “Fat Bottomed Girls” on B side), Mexico, Brazil, Portugal, Sweden, Poland ("Spread Your Wings" on B-side, no p/s), Philippines (no p/s), Chile (no p/s), Argentina (no p/s), South Africa (no p/s).

Usually the single is described as a "double A-side" for marketing reasons, but in fact all known 7" releases have just standard A and B sides. Some (at least Dutch 7" and UK promo 7") do have big "A" letters on both sides, although there are also mentions of the "B" side on a corresponding label.

Peaked at No.11 in UK charts, at No.24 in US charts.

An interesting US promo 12" contains both tracks on both sides, played in alternated order (with sides labeled "X" and "Y" instead of traditional "A" and "B"). In both cases the second track starts when the first one hasn't quite finished yet, creating “unique segue” promo versions.

The 2008 "Singles Collection 1" CD single used the original Hungarian picture sleeve.
