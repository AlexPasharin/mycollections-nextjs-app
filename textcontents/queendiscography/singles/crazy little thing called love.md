EMI used "We Will Rock You" (fast) as a B-side, while Electra used "Spread Your Wings", both “Live Killers” versions. The Japanese release had a slightly different edit of "Spread Your Wings" as other Electra releases. Edit of "We Will Rock You" used by EMI is the same that was released as an A-side by Electra before.

Peaked at No.2 in UK charts, at No.1 in US charts. First Queen single to top the charts in the USA.

This is the first Queen single released commercially in 12" format - in Germany, Venezuela and Columbia (there have been ueen 12" singles released before, but only promos). Columbian releases came in different colored vinyls and contained a unique "extended version" of "Bicycle Race" (track starts from the beginning after the bells part). It is not entirely clear how "official" these Columbian releases are, though.

US 1983 “Spun Gold” series 7" used "Bicycle Race" as B-side. The Canadian Gold Standard (year of issue unknown) 7" used "Play The Game" as B-side.

The 1988 3"CD single did not use any Live Killers tracks and instead contained studio versions of “Spread Your Wings” and "Flash" (single edit).

The 2009 "Singles Collection 2" CD single used the original Spanish picture sleeve.
