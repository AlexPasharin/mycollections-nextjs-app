Released around May 1979 in Germany, Bolivia, Spain and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavian release had a different B-side ("In Only Seven Days"), and there also exists a mispress version of Yugoslavian releases that plays "Dreamerâ€™s Ball" on B-side although it claims to have "In Only Seven Days". All known releases have a picture sleeve.

This is the first Queen single not to be released in both the UK and US.
