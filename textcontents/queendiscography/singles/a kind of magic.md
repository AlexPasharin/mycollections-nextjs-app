Capitol used "Gimme The Prize" as a B-side, but there also exists a misprint 7", whose cover claims the B-side to be "A Dozen Red Roses For My Darling". Also most Capitol promo 7" with the title track on both sides use this erroneous sleeve.

French releases used two different sleeves, both for 7" and 12" - the regular one and the one with Christopher Lambert picture on front.

The 2010 "Singles Collection 3" CD single used the original Japanese picture sleeve.
