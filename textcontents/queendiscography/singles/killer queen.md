Peaked at No.2 in UK charts, at No.12 in US charts, the first Queen single to chart in the US.

This single is often referred to as a "double A-side", but this is technically incorrect - all known releases have "Flick Of The Wrist" clearly marked as B side.

There were originally even 4 different stand-along edits of "Flick of The Wrist" used as a B-side: EMI releases used version with piano intro, Electra releases - version without piano intro. Holland 7" had a unique version with longer piano intro and Japan had an edit similar to the US version but with a different ending.

Re-released in Japan in May 1976 with a new picture sleeve and "Seven Seas Of Rhye" as a B-side.

Released in Venezuela in 12" format with "Keep Yourself Alive" on B-side to accommodate the Queen South American tour, using the same photo as "Save Me" single sleeve for picture sleeve.

In 1983 re-released in the US as part of "Spun Gold" series, with US edit of "Liar" on B-side and no picture sleeve ([https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Killer-Queen-Liar/release/616878](https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Killer-Queen-Liar/release/616878)).

Released in 1984 b/w "You"re My Best Friend" as part of "Golden 45"s series" ([https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Killer-Queen-Youre-My-Best-Friend/master/702235](https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Killer-Queen-Youre-My-Best-Friend/master/702235)).

3"CD released in the UK on 24 Oct 1988 and included a new sloppy-made stand-along version of "Flick Of The Wrist". The Japanese 1991 re-release included the correct original UK 7" stand-along. Both 3"CD releases used an original French picture sleeve.

The 2008 CD single used the original Belgium picture sleeve.
