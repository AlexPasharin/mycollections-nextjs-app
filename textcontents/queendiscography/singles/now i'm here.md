Originally released in UK (17 January 1975), Japan\* (May 1975), Holland\*, France\*, Germany\*, Spain\*, Belgium\*, Hungary\*, Portugal\*, New Zealand, Finland, Ireland, South Africa. Only releases in countries indicated by \* had picture sleeves. Hungarian later (1976) re-press even had a new picture sleeve, different from the one used in the original Hungarian release.

Peaked at No.11 in UK charts.

Ironically not released in the US, despite the fact that the song was inspired by an American tour and even mentions America in the lyrics (and also being a rocker, which one would think might appeal to American taste of the time). In fact this is the first Queen single not to be released in the US. Electra did release it in Japan and New Zealand though.

Re-released in Japan in May 1976 with a new picture sleeve and "Keep Yourself Alive" as a B-side.

The 2008 CD single used the original Spanish picture sleeve.
