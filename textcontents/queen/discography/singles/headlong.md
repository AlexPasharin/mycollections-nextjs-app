Originally released in US (17 January 17 1991, cassette and promo CD), UK (13 May 1991, also 12", CD and cassette), EEC (also 12" and CD), France (also promo 12" and CD), Australasia (no picture sleeve 7" and cassette), Japan (CD), Holland (CD).

First Queen release by their new North American label Hollywood Records.

In the UK 12" was also released on clear picture disk vinyl.

Peaked at No. 14 in UK charts.

The 2010 "Singles Collection 4" CD single used the original UK picture sleeve. For some weird reason (maybe by mistake?) the LP edit of title track was used, instead of standard album version, which was an original Parlophone A-side.
