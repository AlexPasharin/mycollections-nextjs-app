Originally released in US (17 January 17 1991, cassette and promo CD), UK (13 May 1991, also 12", CD and cassette), EEC (also 12" and CD), France (also promo 12" and CD), Australasia (no picture sleeve 7" and cassette), Japan (CD), Holland (CD). UK releases contain normal full length album (CD) version of the title song, except for 7", which contains so-called "LP edit". This is not mentioned on the sleeve. It is entirely possible other countries' 7" releases (including French 7" which contains different B-side) also use LP edit, but this is not confirmed one way or the other.

First Queen release by their new North American label Hollywood Records.

In the UK 12" was also released on clear picture disk vinyl.

Peaked at No. 14 in UK charts.

The 2010 "Singles Collection 4" CD single used the original UK picture sleeve. Staying true to original UK 7" release it also uses LP edit of the title track without mentioning it anywhere in the package.
