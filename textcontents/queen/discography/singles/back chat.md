Originally released in UK\* (9 August 1982, also 12"), US\* (23 November 1982, also promo 33 rpm 12"), Japan\* (October 1982), Peru, Spain\* (also 12"), Holland\* (also 12"), Greece (promo 12" only), Zimbabwe, Italy\*, France\*, Guatemala, Canada, Ireland, South Africa, India, Brazil\* (33 rpm), Argentina (promo 7" only), Mexico\* (12" and promo 7").

This is the first Queen single to be officially released in 12" format in the UK, and also probably the first one to have an official extended version on commercial 12" releases (there has been Columbian 12" release of “Another One Bites The Dust” that claims to have an extended version of the title track, but this is unconfirmed, and even if is true it is not clear if it is official).

Peaked at No.60 in UK charts, did not chart in the US.

The 2009 "Singles Collection 2" CD single used the original UK picture sleeve.
