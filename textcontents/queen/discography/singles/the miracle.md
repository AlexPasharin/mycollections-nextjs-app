Originally released in the UK (27 November 1989, also 12", cassette and CD), EEC (also 12"), Australasia (also cassette), Austria (3"CD).

In the UK in addition to standard vinyl 7" and 12" releases, there were also a limited edition 7" hologram pack and a special 12" with autographed color print.

Peaked at No. 21 in UK charts.

Argentinian misprint promo 7" claims A side is a track by Paul McCartney, but in reality it is "The Miracle" by Queen.

There is also a report of a 1-sided US promo cassette by Hollywood Records with some “edit” version of a title track ([https://www.discogs.com/Queen-The-Miracle/release/10291241](https://www.discogs.com/Queen-The-Miracle/release/10291241)), but it is not backed up by any other evidence, so not taken into account into tracklists.

The 2010 "Singles Collection 4" CD single used the original UK picture sleeve.
