This is actually the first official release of a Queen single as a picture disk as 12" is also released in UK as a picture disk. Unlike standard black vinyl UK 12" release, this has only 2 tracks (same as 7") and no picture sleeve. Similarly there are 2 different versions of European 12" - one has only 2 tracks and the other has 3 tracks.

UK 7" original sleeve was withdrawn and replaced with a new sleeve in which Rogerâ€™s head is in a different position, "photoshopped" really badly into the original sleeve.

There exists a mispress UK 12" picture disk which in reality plays tracks from Frankie Goes To Hollywood 12" single War (Hidden) ([https://www.discogs.com/Frankie-Goes-To-Hollywood-War-Hidden/release/10950462](https://www.discogs.com/Frankie-Goes-To-Hollywood-War-Hidden/release/10950462)).

Peaked at No. 6 in UK charts and at No. 72 in US charts.

The 2010 "Singles Collection 3" CD single used the original USA picture sleeve.
