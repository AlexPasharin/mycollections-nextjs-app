Originally released in UK\* (26 November 1984, also 12" and reportedly a mispress unique 5"), US\* (27 November 1984, 33 rpm 12"), Philippines\* (12"), Holland\* (also 12", normal and a mispress which misses the actual title track), South Africa\* (also 12"), Canada\* (12"), Zimbabwe, Italy\*, Germany (promo 7"), Portugal\*, Australia, Brazil\* (33rpm), Ireland. Only releases in countries indicated by \* had picture sleeves. Capitol 12" releases, for some reason, had an erroneous tracklist for B side, with incorrect track order.

There is a double A-side UK promo 7" with “Man On The Prowl” as “first track” ([https://www.discogs.com/release/6447013-Queen-Man-On-The-Prowl](https://www.discogs.com/release/6447013-Queen-Man-On-The-Prowl)).

Originally "Man On The Prowl" was supposed to be released as a 5th single from “The Works”, but was withdrawn in favour of "Thank God It's Christmas". Some copies of an original withdrawn single were printed in Ireland (see "Queen promo, withdrawn and other obscure singles" for details).

There is a famous "Peace In The Middle East" one-sided Israelian 12" from 1993 ([https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Thank-God-Its-Christmas-Special-Peace-In-The-Middle-East-Mix/release/1795349](https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Thank-God-Its-Christmas-Special-Peace-In-The-Middle-East-Mix/release/1795349)), but I consider it an unofficial release, so it is not listed here.

Peaked at No.21 in UK charts.

The 2009 "Singles Collection 2" CD single used the original UK picture sleeve.
