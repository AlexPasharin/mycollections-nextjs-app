Released in Japan (in July 1982, with ps) and the USA (in November 1982, no p/s). Did not chart in the US. Some sources suggest the US release used "Calling All Girls" as B-side, some claim it had "Back Chat" (unknown version) instead.

US promo 12" contained a unique extended remix of “Staying Power”, which never surfaced officially anywhere else.
