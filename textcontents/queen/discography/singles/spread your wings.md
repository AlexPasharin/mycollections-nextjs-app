Originally released in UK\* (10 February 1978), Guatemala, Chile, Italy\*, Germany\*, Ireland, Portugal\*, Brazil, Spain\*, Belgium\*, Holland\*, France\*. Only releases in countries indicated by \* had picture sleeves. There exists a French mispress release, with A side label claiming to contain “We Are The Champions” instead of the title track.

Some sources claim UK 7" contained a unique edit of the title track which fades out earlier, but this does not seem to be true.

This is the first Queen single not released by Electra anywhere (they went with "It’s Late" instead).

Peaked at No.34 in UK charts.

The 2008 “Singles Collection 1” CD single used the original French picture sleeve.

On 22 October 2021 re-released with new picture sleeve and B-side on green vinyl 7" as one of 4 limited edition (1000 copies) 'The Greatest Pop-Up Store' singles.
