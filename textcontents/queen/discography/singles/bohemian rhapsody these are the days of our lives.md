Originally released in the UK (9 December 1991, CD, 7" and cassette), Europe (CD made in Holland, 7" made in EEC, cassette made in French or Holland), Australia (cassette, CD made in Holland - special edition with bonus poster), Japan (CD, with bonus booklet).

While in UK 7" sides were labelled A and AA, in EEC 7" had traditional A and B sides. Still this is the first Queen single
release which is truly double A-side. Although generally also singles "Killer Queen", "We Are The Champions" and "Bicycle Race" are often referred to as "double A-sides", in reality original releases used traditional A and B sides and the "double A-side" status is more of a marketing trick than actual fact.

Peaked at No. 1 in UK charts.
