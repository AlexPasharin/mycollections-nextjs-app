EMI territories used a single version of "I’m In Love With My Car" (with engine noises in the beginning), while Electra releases used the standard album version (except for Japan, which used EMI single version). The UK 3"CD (released 24 Oct 1988) also used the standard album version of "I’m In Love With My Car", while the Japanese 1991 3"CD had a single version. Turkish 7" used “Sweet Lady” as a B-side, while in Poland “Death On Two Legs” was used.

On 26 July 1978 a special limited edition numbered promo blue vinyl 7" was released by EMI in the UK to celebrate the "Queen's Award For Industry For Export Achievement". Same year single was also re-issued in France with a new picture sleeve, accompanied by a famous rare French promo release, which featured a rare unique edited version of “Bohemian Rhapsody”.

Around 1982 the title track was reissued in North America backed with "You're my best friend" as a part of "Spun Gold" series (no picture sleeve, [https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Bohemian-Rhapsody-Youre-My-Best-Friend/release/2480724](https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Bohemian-Rhapsody-Youre-My-Best-Friend/release/2480724)).

UK 3"CD released in 1988 has an amusing indexing error - title track starts with the final "swirling" sounds from “Good Company” that precedes it on the "A Night At The Opera" album.

In 1992 a 1-track promo CD was released by Hollywood Records - both to promote "Classic Queen" album and the song’s appearance in "Wayne's World" movie ([https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Bohemian-Rhapsody/release/1801739](https://www.discogs.com/Queen-Bohemian-Rhapsody/release/1801739)).

In 1995 original 7" was again released on purple vinyl to commemorate the Tenth Annual Queen Fan Club Convention (limited edition).

In 2000 a special 3"CD single with a new track listing (and a unique picture sleeve) was released in Japan related to the Toyota commercial in which "Bohemian Rhapsody" was used. It contained a karaoke version of the title track unique to this release (otherwise the same as the version released on "Greatest Karaoke Hits" but has no click track in the beginning).

On 19 December 2005 released as download only on iTunes and the Queen Digital Store, to mark the 30th anniversary of the original release.

The 2008 "Singles Collection" CD single used the picture sleeve from the 1978 UK "Queen's Award For Industry" Blue Vinyl reissue.

"A Night At The Odeon" Box set (released on 20 November 2015) included a "Bohemian Rhapsody" 12" single backed with a unique live soundtrack recording of "Now I’m Her"”.

On 27 November 2015 the original single was re-released on 12" to celebrate its 40th Anniversary. For some reason this issue used the original Italian picture sleeve, however, the photo of the band was mirror-reversed for some reason. Also a 1 track promo CD was issued, that one had the original UK picture sleeve.

On 13 April 2019 original 7" single was reissued on colored purple/yellow vinyl for Record Store Day, with a new, "Bohemian Rhapsody" movie related, picture sleeve.
