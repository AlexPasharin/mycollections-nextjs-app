Originally released in the UK (23 October 1995), Holland, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, US. The misprint of the US 1-track promo CD had "Made In Heaven" instead of the title track by mistake. Single was released in all countries originally in 1995, except for the US, where it was released in 1996, most likely in June.

This is the first Queen UK single release without an official publicly sold 7" release, although there do exist a jukebox 7".

In the UK "part 2" CD was released one week after "part 1", i.e. on 30 November 1995.

Peaked at No. 2 in UK charts.

In 1999 a promo CD-rom was released in Switzerland to promote both Swiss tourism and “Greatest Hits III” album.

The 2010 "Singles Collection 4" CD single used the original UK picture sleeve.
